Practice: Connect Four
Connect Four is a board game. Players take turns placing tokens of their color into a vertical grid. They drop to the bottom,
and if anyone has four of their color in a straight line, they've won!

Create a program that simulates the moves of an existing Connect Four game.

It will read a file that contains a history of the moves in a game. Assume the playing board is made of columns numbered 1 through 7.
The file will have one line for each move (players alternate). The number in that line is the column the current player placed a token in.

Your board should be represented as a class. Think about how to concisely store the tokens that have been dropped in the board.

Use the following example move file. Save it in something like 4-moves.txt

4
3
5
6
4
4
5
3
6
2
7

This moves file recreates this game.

After each move, print out a representation of the board. You can use R and Y to represent the pieces.

Advanced

Once all moves are done, also print out what player, if any, won.
