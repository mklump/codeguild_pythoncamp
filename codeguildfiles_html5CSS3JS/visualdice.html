    Practice: Visual Dice:
    Save your solution as visualdice.html, visualdice.css, and visualdice.js.
    Give the user a number input box with a button "roll". When they click that button, make that
    many 6-sided dice appear on the screen.
    The dice should appear visually as dice, although for testing you can just start with numbers.
    Come up with any reasonable way to display the visual dice.
    If the user clicks any of the dice, it re-rolls just that one. If they re-click the roll button,
    erase the dice and roll new ones.
    At the bottom of the screen, show the sum of all the dice currently out.

    Advanced:
    Get rid of the input and button. Instead ask for a number of sides to the die and have an "add" button.
    When they click that, it adds that kind of die to the table.
    They can still click on a die to re-roll it, but add a little "X" to delete that die. Still show the sum.
