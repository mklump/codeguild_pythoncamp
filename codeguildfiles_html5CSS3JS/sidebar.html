    Code File for checked sidebar.html
    by: Matthew James K on 4/29/2016

Recreate the following sample layout.

Practice: Sidebar Layout

A sidebar that is 20% of the page width, with:
   *A site title
   *A vertical list of nav links
   *Don't worry about making the sidebar full height or a different background color
A main page taking up the rest of the width, with:
   *A page title
   *A large image taking up the full width
   *Three small paragraphs aligned under the image taking up the full width
   *A full-width paragraph after that
   *Reasonable spacing between all of these elements
You can fill in whatever example text and splash graphic you want.
