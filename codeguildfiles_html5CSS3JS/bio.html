<!-- Practice: Bio
Write up a short bio webpage for yourself or someone famous. Include:
    • A written introduction
    • A picture of them (or a placeholder)
    • A list of places where they've lived
    • A quote from them
    • Proper structuring HTML elements
Advanced
    • Peruse the complete HTML element list and try to incorporate some of them

    Practice: Bio Style
    Keep your bio's HTML as bio_old.html and save the style sheet as bio.css.
    Let's vamp up your bio. Using only an external stylesheet, add the following stylistic features:
    •Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color
    •Change the typeface of the quote
    •Add a rounded border to the picture
    •Change the bullet points on the list of places to be the gaudy

    Let's practice using layout in your bio:
    • Center the entire content of the body; use a flexbox.
    • Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it.
    • Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better.
    • Add a short multi-column section using flexboxes.
Advanced
    • Try out using media queries to have the layout change on small screens / phones
