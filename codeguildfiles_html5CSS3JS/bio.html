    Practice: Bio
Write up a short bio webpage for yourself or someone famous. Include:
    • A written introduction
    • A picture of them (or a placeholder)
    • A list of places where they've lived
    • A quote from them
    • Proper structuring HTML elements
Advanced
    • Peruse the complete HTML element list and try to incorporate some of them

    Practice: Bio Style
    Keep your bio's HTML as bio_old.html and save the style sheet as bio.css.
    Let's vamp up your bio. Using only an external stylesheet, add the following stylistic features:
    •Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color
    •Change the typeface of the quote
    •Add a rounded border to the picture
    •Change the bullet points on the list of places to be the gaudy

    Let's practice using layout in your bio:
    • Center the entire content of the body; use a flexbox.
    • Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it.
    • Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better.
    • Add a short multi-column section using flexboxes.
Advanced
    • Try out using media queries to have the layout change on small screens / phones

          Bio Practice Problem: Your bio needs more work. You have the basics of HTML, CSS.
          But you haven't showed an understanding of the box model and applying spacing,
          you are not actually using flex box and instead relying on percentage widths
          to recreate the same effect, and you seem to be mixing up using CSS IDs and
          classes to style single elements.
          Practice using more semantic classes that capture general cases.
