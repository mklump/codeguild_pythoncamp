Checked Practice: Flutter
Let's make a mini Twitter clone called Flutter where people post Flutts.

/ shows the last 10 Flutts.
/q?=QUERY shows the last 10 Flutts containing QUERY text.
/post is a form to submit a Flutts. There is "user name" and "text".
/post/submit is the ack page. A new Flutt is given the timestamp of the acknowledgement.
/USER_NAME shows the last 10 Flutts by a user.

Advanced:
Use the Django user auth system to provide:

A login page at /login.
Only let logged-in users post Flutts.
Instead of storing "user name" store "user ID" with each Flutt.
Automatically fill in the user ID of the person logged in when posting a Flutt.
Change the /USER_NAME route to a /USER_ID route with the same functionality.
