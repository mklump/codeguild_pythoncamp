Practice: Jokes -
    Save your solution as jokes.
    Have a page to submit jokes via a form. A joke has a "setup" and a "punchline" input. Submitted
    jokes should be saved in a global array in your logic module.
    Have a listing page where jokes are shown. Hide the punch lines until someone clicks on the setup.
Advanced:
    Use AJAX to submit your jokes.
